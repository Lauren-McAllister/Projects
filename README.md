This is the R script I wrote to execute genomics and bioinformatics tests for my undergraduate research thesis. It includes code to execute QTL maps, whole-genome 
ANOVAs, gene trees, and other representations of data. Additionally, it includes filtering options for many of these tests. The data is not available to upload 
because the research is not yet published.
